# To construct a spatial random expander graph in R, we can follow these steps:
#   
#   Generate a set of random points in a two-dimensional space. We can use the runif() function to generate random values between 0 and 1, and then scale them to the desired range of x and y coordinates.
# R
# Copy code
# n <- 100   # number of points
# x <- runif(n, 0, 10)   # x coordinates between 0 and 10
# y <- runif(n, 0, 10)   # y coordinates between 0 and 10
# points <- cbind(x, y)   # combine x and y coordinates
# Compute the Euclidean distance between every pair of points. We can use the dist() function to compute the pairwise distance matrix.
# R
# Copy code
# distances <- dist(points)
# Define a threshold distance r that determines which pairs of points are considered neighbors. We want the graph to be an expander, which means that every point should have a large number of neighbors, so we set r to be a small fraction of the maximum distance.
# R
# Copy code
# r <- 0.1 * max(distances)
# Construct an adjacency matrix A for the graph, where A[i,j] = 1 if the distance between points i and j is less than r, and A[i,j] = 0 otherwise.
# R
# Copy code
# A <- as.matrix(distances < r)
# Make sure the graph is connected by adding edges between pairs of disconnected vertices. We can use the igraph package to do this. First, we convert the adjacency matrix to an igraph object.
# R
# Copy code
# library(igraph)
# g <- graph.adjacency(A)
# Check if the graph is connected using the is.connected() function. If the graph is not connected, we add edges between pairs of disconnected vertices until the graph becomes connected.
# R
# Copy code
# while (!is.connected(g)) {
#   non_edges <- get.non.edges(g)
#   e <- sample(non_edges, 1)
#   g <- add_edges(g, e)
# }
# Visualize the graph using the plot() function.
# R
# Copy code
# plot(g, layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold)
# This will generate a spatial random expander graph with n vertices in a two-dimensional space. The graph will have a small-world property, meaning that it will have both high clustering and short path lengths between vertices.

# The code first creates an initial Erdos-Renyi graph with n nodes and m/n edges per node. It then adds coordinates to the nodes and defines a function to calculate the distance between two nodes based on their coordinates. The add_node function adds a new node to the graph and connects it to m of its nearest neighbors, with a constraint that new edges are only added if they are within a distance r of the new node. The add_edge function chooses two random nodes and adds a new edge between them, subject to the same geographical constraint. Finally, the code iterates through 10,000 steps of the model, with a probability p of adding a new edge and a probability 1-p of adding a new node. The resulting network model is plotted using the igraph package.

Explanation of the code:

We first define the parameters n (number of nodes), m (number of connections for new nodes), and p (probability of adding a new edge).
We then initialize the network by creating an adjacency matrix (adj_mat) and a location matrix (loc_mat). The adjacency matrix is initialized with all zeros, and the location matrix is initialized with random values between 0 and 1.
We define a function pref_attach that implements the preferential attachment mechanism. It takes as input the degree of each node and an exponent alpha, and returns a random node index with probability proportional to degree^alpha.
We then loop over each node in the network and add either a new node or a new edge with the specified probabilities. If a new node is added, we choose m existing nodes to connect to using the preferential attachment mechanism. If a new edge is added, we choose two existing nodes at random that are not already connected.
Finally, we add a geographical constraint to the network by setting the adjacency matrix elements to zero for edges that exceed the distance threshold r. We do this by looping over all pairs of connected nodes and checking their distance in the location matrix.
